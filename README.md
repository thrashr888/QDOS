# A Web-Based QDOS II Clone

![QDOS-2](http://www.fcnoticias.com.br/wp-content/uploads/QDOS-2.jpg)

I loved QDOS so here it is in the browser. Don't run this on servers you don't want hacked into. Only the directory listing and traversal works, so it's read-only at the moment.

I'm throwing it on GitHub just to back-up my work.


## Run It

    > git clone https://github.com/thrashr888/QDOS.git; cd QDOS
    > node server


## TODO

- .. directories
- date formatting
- improve styling
- tag files
- copy, move, erase, rename, attributes
- modal
- file edit
- image viewer
- change drive?
- print
- search/find
- DOS Cmd?
- Windows?
