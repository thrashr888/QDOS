# A Web-Based Q-DOS II Clone

![The real Q-DOS II](http://www.fcnoticias.com.br/wp-content/uploads/QDOS-2.jpg)

I loved Q-DOS so here it is in the browser. Don't run this on servers you don't want hacked into. Only the directory listing and traversal works, so it's read-only at the moment.

I'm throwing it on GitHub just to back-up my work.

Since it's somewhat tough to find, I'm rehosting [Q-DOS II for DOSBox](http://thrashr888.s3.amazonaws.com/Q-DOS%20II%20Version%202.0%20-%205.25.7z)


## Run It

    > git clone https://github.com/thrashr888/QDOS.git; cd QDOS
    > node server


## TODO

- improve styling
- pages
- copy, move, erase, rename, attributes
- file edit
- image viewer
- dir tree viewer
- status page
- change drive?
- print
- search/find
- DOS Cmd?
- Windows?
